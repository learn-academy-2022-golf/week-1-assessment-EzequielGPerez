# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is the code thats on your device that you can work on locally. Github is a free online resource kind of like an internet for coding where many people can work on the same codes, modify them, and retrieve them. One is for coding on your local machine, and one is a hub for codes. 

Researched answer: Git is in your local system, not the cloud. Github IS esxclusively cloud-based. As long as you have the code you could use git offline. They both track changes. Git is a software command-line tool and github is a service, a graphical user interface. Git came first in 2005 and Github in 2008.  

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: a strict equality will return a boolean value. If the values match in data type and the data itself, then it will return 'true'. If they are different in any way like data type for example, 3 and three, it will come back false. 

Researched answer: Both loose and strict equality operators return a boolean value. loose equality will convert both data types then compare them (pretty cool) but the strict equality does not convert any of the data, the data has to be exctly the same value and data type or it will be false.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is what spot in the code a piece of data correlates with, and it is given a value of an index. (first starting at 0 index) Depending on the type of data type, it will then give an index value to these pieces of data. For example if we ask for an index length value for a single string with multiple elements in it, it will give us how many elements are in the string. If there are multiple strings it will count out how many strings there are. 

Researched answer: An index is know as a read-only property. It is the position that an element has in that string or array. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings seem similar but are also different. Both arrays and strings can hold a lot of data in them but they have different characteristics. An array can hold a string for example and it can hold multiple strings in them. Each string would be its own element inside the array. A string has characters in them, mostly for end users to see. A string can hold just one character or multiple characters inside of them. Arrays need a variable declaration, an assignment operator, and []'s to hold the data inside. You can use commas to separate the data. A string needs either '', "", or `` to begin and end the string at each end of the string and characters inside to not leave the string blank when called upon. 

Researched answer: The researched answer says that an array is a data structure that stores elements of same data type and a stirng is a set of characters. Arrays can hold a collection of elements while strings have characters and can only store characters. An array can hold different types of data. Apparently they both have a fixed size but a string can be altered. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming consists of 2 individuals (I guess could be more people) that have a specific role they must stick to, if they want this method to succeed, one being a navigator, and the other the driver. The navigator is the one who has documentation and instructions of what needs to be done to reach the goal. They will instruct the driver on what to code in the text editor or where to navigate be it the terminal or the internet if they for example need to get a main from GitHub. The driver is the one being led by the navigator, they are in charge of writing code in the text editor, test the code for both them and the navigator to see if it works, and navigate through GitHub, terminal, or any other places need be. Both need to be open to the others ideas and not afraid to ask questions or give suggestions. It is recommended to switch roles so both get experienced being the driver and/or navigator. 

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique where 2 programmers work at one workstation together. One is a driver and one is a navigator, the driver writes code while the navigator reviews the code as it is written. They switch frequently. This increases the man-hours needed to write code, but the outcome is that the code has less defects. They can help eachother stay focused. Both bring their own coding experience to the table and may process the problem in different ways than each other. They can learn more about coding together as they both might not know the same exact things as the other coder. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Functions can be assigned to variables. That means they can be used in other functions as parameters or can even return that function. Its kinda like divs but functions instead. Or like the movie Inception (my all time favorite movie)

2. Jest: Jest is for JS and it is for testing JS codebase. Gives results quickly and has many features. It does not need much configuration and is well documented. 

3. Objects: Objects are variables that can contain many values. For example my dog (object) can have a collar (value).Objects can be used in functions when they have a method. 

4. Method: A method is an action that can be done on objects. One example used is a cars method would be stopping and going. 

5. Classes: A class is not an object but it is a layout for JS objects. another example given is a class would be "car" and the objects would be "make" and "year"
